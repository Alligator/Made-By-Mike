<p>The Echo Base is a design by slacker, a very talented gent from the DIYStompboxes forums. He's kindly agreed for me to build and sell his design if I donate £10 for each one sold to Oxfam, which seems like a great deal to me. The Echo Base is a handmade analogue-voiced digital delay based around the popular PT2399 delay chip, it can be easily coaxed into a very Deluxe Memory Manesque self oscillation, give you delays of over a second, and has a modulation section for you add some subtle tape-echo style warble to your delays, or even to get Chorus and Vibrato sounds with at low delay time settings. It's a complex beast which is reflected in the price, but it's a great sounding delay pedal. I have one on my board while my Electro-Harmonix Deluxe Memory Man lies in it's box - because it's Huge and needs it's own power supply.</p>
