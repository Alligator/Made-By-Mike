		<h1>Modded 808 Tubescreamer - £75</h1>
Overdrive<br/>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wc0w2UStF8" target="_blank">Demo</a>
<p>The fabled TS-808 has appeared on countless classic performances and is still as richly loved as it ever has been, with originals fetching pricely sums on the second hand collectors market - however there is nothing magical about this circuit or the parts that make it great - they still make Op-amps, Diodes, Resistors and Capacitors as well as they used to (better in fact in some cases) and great sounding reproductions can be made without any need for snake oil or unobtanium. I build a reproduction of the TS-808 with an added Voice control to change the tonal response and gain character simulataneously to give you more available options, and if you should need it more low-end content to your sound. All the classic Tubescreamer sounds are in this box, along with a few more to add to your sonic palette.</p>
