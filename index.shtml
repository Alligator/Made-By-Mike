		<h1>Made By Mike</h1>
		<p>Hi, I'm Mike. You might recognise me from such videos as "that one off youtube where the guy can barely play". I also build pedals. All pedals available via this website are made by hand, by me, in the UK.</p>
		<p>I build pedals because I enjoy the process but nothing gives me more of a kick than to hear from a satisfied customer who is in love with their new pedal.</p>
		<p>I use the highest quality parts I can source.</p>
